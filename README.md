# Rephobia: VR Exposure Therapy Prototype

Rephobia is a virtual reality application prototype designed to help users confront and overcome specific phobias through controlled VR exposure therapy. Created with the aim of supporting mental health treatment, this prototype offers an immersive experience where users can safely face their fears in a gradual, guided manner. Initially developed as a research tool, Rephobia was built using **Flutter** and **Android Studio** for quick prototyping and testing in clinical trial settings.

### Overview

The Rephobia app provides a safe and customizable VR environment to help users progressively desensitize to their phobias, whether it's fear of heights, spiders, confined spaces, or other common fears. Developed as a prototype to test feasibility and gather data for future iterations, Rephobia is not yet a full product but serves as a proof of concept for VR-based phobia treatment.

### Features

- **Immersive VR Simulations**: Users engage in realistic, VR-based exposure scenarios designed to elicit manageable levels of anxiety, allowing them to gradually confront their fears.
- **Adjustable Exposure Levels**: The app lets users select and adjust the intensity of their exposure, offering tailored options to suit individual therapy progression.
- **Progress Tracking**: Rephobia records user responses and progress across sessions to provide insights into their desensitization journey.
- **Simple Interface**: With a streamlined, user-friendly interface, users can easily navigate the app's features.

### Installation

#### Prerequisites
- **VR-Ready Android Device**: A compatible VR headset is required (such as Meta Quest or an inexpensive smartphone-compatible headset).
- **Android Studio**: Download and install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) to build the application from source.
- **Flutter SDK**: Ensure that [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) is installed on your machine.

#### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/rephobia
    ```
2. **Open the Project in Android Studio**:
   - Launch Android Studio and select "Open an existing Android Studio project."
   - Navigate to the cloned repository folder and open it.

3. **Run the App**:
   - Connect your Android device or set up an emulator.
   - Click the "Run" button in Android Studio to install the app on your device.

> **Note**: This prototype is in early development and may have limited compatibility with some devices.

### Usage

1. **Launch the App**: Once installed, open Rephobia on your VR-compatible Android device.
2. **Select a Phobia**: Choose from a selection of supported phobia scenarios (e.g., heights, spiders).
3. **Adjust Settings**: Configure exposure intensity and session duration based on your comfort level and therapy needs.
4. **Begin Exposure**: Enter the VR experience and engage with the scenario at your own pace.
5. **Track Progress**: Review session feedback and monitor progress over multiple sessions to gauge improvement.

> **Important**: Rephobia is a research prototype and is not intended as a substitute for professional therapy. Users should consult a licensed mental health professional before using the app.

### Technical Details

- **Built with**: Flutter for cross-platform compatibility, Android Studio for Android development.
- **VR Integration**: Simple VR support through a smartphone-compatible headset.
- **Data Tracking**: Prototype includes basic tracking of user interactions and exposure duration.
- **Scenarios**: A limited selection of VR environments for common phobias, optimized for testing and research purposes.

### Limitations and Future Work

This prototype represents an initial step in VR exposure therapy and has the following limitations:
- **Limited Phobia Scenarios**: Currently, only a few phobia types are supported.
- **Basic Progress Tracking**: The tracking system is simple and lacks advanced analytics.
- **Prototype Quality**: The app is not fully optimized for a smooth VR experience; improvements are planned for future versions.
- **Clinical Validation Needed**: Further clinical trials are necessary to validate efficacy and usability in therapeutic contexts.

Future versions may include:
- Expanded scenario options
- Enhanced VR interactions
- Integration with clinical tools for in-depth tracking and data export.
